When I was in college, I went off to the mountains for a weekend of hiking
with an older, wiser friend of twenty-two. After setting up our tent, we sat by
a stream, watching the water swirl around rocks, talking about our lives. At
one point she described how she was learning to be “her own best friend.” A
wave of sadness came over me, and I broke down sobbing. I was the furthest
thing from my own best friend. I was continually harassed by an inner judge
who was merciless, nit-picking, demanding and always on the job. My
guiding assumption was, “Something is fundamentally wrong with me,” as I
struggled to control and fix what felt like a basically flawed self.
Over the last several decades, through my work with tens thousands of clients
and meditation students, I’ve come to see the sense of personal deficiency as
epidemic. When we feel unworthy we are in a trance that causes tremendous
suffering. Yet, I have found in my own life and with countless others that we
can awaken from this trance through mindful self-compassion. We can come
to trust the goodness and purity of our hearts.
In order to unfold, self-compassion depends on honest, direct contact with our
own vulnerability. This compassion fully blossoms when we actively offer
care to ourselves. Yet when we’ve gotten stuck in the trance of unworthiness,
it often feels impossible to arouse self-compassion. To help people address
feelings of insecurity and unworthiness, I like to share a meditation I call the
RAIN of Self-Compassion.
The acronym RAIN is an easy-to-remember tool for practicing mindfulness
and compassion using the following four steps:
Recognize what is going on;
Allow the experience to be there, just as it is;
Investigate with interest and care;
Nurture with self-compassion.
You can take your time and explore RAIN as a stand-alone meditation or
move through the steps whenever challenging feelings arise.
