What is important about this system?

1. Better Auth -> Auth (in general) -> Data Security (in general)
2. React Router -> Routing -> HTTP Handling -> Server (??)
3. React -> Compilers -> JS + HTML + CSS


### React Router:

Is an HTTP Handler for React (?)

SO it handles GETS and POSTS to my React Server, in addition to just serving the react app?

In fact, it handles the GETS/POSTS BEFORE it serves my React App, and it serves the React App one page at a time, split up into "mini-apps" in a sense, via SSR.
